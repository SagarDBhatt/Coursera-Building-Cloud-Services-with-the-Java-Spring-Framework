**** CLOUD SERVICE:

1. The variety of services (Applications) delivered to customers on demand over the internet.
2. For Eg: Online calculator is cloud service where User can add values and do calculations.
3. Another eg: Creating an account of website - Facebook. User passing his data, facebook cloud service receive
    that data, validate the data if needed and store it in the server (cloud storage). This service / application
    is on-demand (user can use anytime).
4. The company does not need to built hardware. Just deploy the application on cloud.

**** HTTP Request Methods:
1. In HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol), always client sends the request to the server.
2. Each request has "Request Method" which specify the server what exactly a user looking for.
3. Based on the request User provides, server will respond with resources. for eg: A user requested for
    https://google.com and server responded with the webpage.
4. There are four main request methods.
    i. GET      :   Read Operation
    ii. POST    :   Write Operation (Create a user; sign up form)
    iii. PUT    :   Update operation
    iv. DELETE  :   Delete operation.

5. A user sends Request Line.
    Request line = Request Method + Resource (path).

-> Server needs to know kind of request it is and what is the resources user looking for.
-> Resource is usually a path in the request line. For eg: google.com/jeans/aeropostale/signup.

**** HEADERS:
1. User needs to send the data on a specific manner. Same way, server needs to respond the data in a proper manner.
2. This is defined in the "Header" - "Extra information to help server identify the response type. "
3. Header includes below information.
    i. language     : which language to provide response.
    ii. Character-Set
    iii. content-type   : what type the response should return for eg: application/json
    iv. cookies: A small amount of data server sends along with the response. This saves user name, sends the user
            activities back to server for better serve next time

**** BODY:
1. It is optional part of request. It is core data sends to server.
2. Body includes JSON payload. for eg, at the time of user sign up to a website, User informatio is passed in
    the form of JSON Payload to the server.

**** URL (Uniform Resource Locator):
1. Client sends the request to the server in terms of request method and resource type.
2. Client provide URL to specify the resource.

for eg: https://www.google.com?city=denver&age=25

    Here, anything after "?" is called Query parameters.

    key1=city, value1=denver
    key2=age,  value2=25.

**** MIME TYPE:
1. When server and user sends data, it could be of different format (xml, json, raw text ect.).
2. Along with the data, user/server needs to specify what is the format of the data.

3. MIME type is the identifier of type of format which included in the body.
    "Content-type" header provides MIME type. Common MIME types are:

    Eg: image/jpg
        image/png
        text/plain
        text/html
        application/json
        application/xml.

**** Methods to send data in Body:
1. There are two ways, user can sends data through body.
    i. URL Encoding : Pass key, value pair in the URL. Eg: https://www.google.com?city=denver&age=25
    ii. Multipart: provide various parts in URL. Eg: facebook.com/user/city/denver

2. When sending large file to server, use multipart method.
    When sending small amount of data, use URL encoding method.
3. URL encoding is efficient when sending small amount of data. (key value pair)

**** HTTP Response Anatomy:
1. When client sends request, server takes appropriate action to find resources.
2. Server needs to respond with message whether the requested resources is found, Or the resource is moved
    or server is unable to process the request.
3. Server response line contains
        i. Numerical status code (200 - OK, 400 - error, 500 - server down)
        ii. Phrase to describe the message.

4. If the resource is found then Server sends Header and Body. Body contains the resource in JSON,XML format.
    Header contains meta data. Header provide "Content-type". (Values could be "application/json".

**** HTTP Response Codes:

    1XX : Information. (Provides information as a response from server)
    2XX : Success. [200 - OK. Server handled the request successfully.]
    3XX : Redirection. [Page/Resource that user is looking has been moved to another location.]
    4XX : Client Error. [404 - Page/Resource not found. Invalid request / URL]
    5XX : Server Error. [500 - Server is unable to handle the request ]

**** Cookies :
1. Cookies are the small code that server sends to clients computer along with the response.
2. This program keeps sending the User activity of the website to the server for better user experience.
3. Cookies saves client details so client does not need to log in again, sends promotions based on search.
4. Usually, cookies tracks client activities on the same website and not the other activities due to privacy issues.
    But, nowadays, cross platform tracking is performed. So client search camera on amazon then Facebook, instagram shows advertisement on camera that day.
5. Major cookies have expiration time i.e. Session time and then cookies stopped working.

**** PROTOCOL LAYERING & APPLICATION DESIGN:

1. REST, SOAP webservices are layered on HTTP protocol.


*** HTTP POLLING:
1. HTTP is client Driven protocol i.e. Client is initiating the communication. Client sends a request and server responded.
2. Server received updates but can not send to client until client requested. Client needs to decide how frequent request needs to send to server for update.
3. One of the method is - Polling. Client requests server for an update at every T seconds. Even if there is no update, server allocated the
    resources, check for the update and sends the "no update"  response.
4. If client does not receive any update in T seconds then client exponentially increase the time gap between two requests to 2T, 4T, 8T etc.
