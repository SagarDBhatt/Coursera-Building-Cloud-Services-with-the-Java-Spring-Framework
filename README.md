Coursera Certificate on Building Cloud Services with the Java Spring Framework. 

This MOOC describes by example how to build cloud services via the use of object-oriented design techniques; Java programming language features; 
Java Servlets, the Java Spring Framework; and cloud computing platforms, such as Amazon Web Services. 
Due to the importance of building secure and scalable mobile/cloud platforms, this MOOC will not only show you how to build cloud services, 
but how to do so securely, scalably, and efficiently. Security and scalability topics will be woven into discussions of cloud service 
creation so that students learn, from the start, how to create robust cloud services.
